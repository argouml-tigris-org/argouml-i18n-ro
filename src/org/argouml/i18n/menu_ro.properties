# Keystructure:
#
# [file].[name of menu] or
# [file].[name of menu].mnemonic
# [file].[flag for item].[name of menuitem].mnemonic
#
# Comments:
#
# The first menu in this file is the menu of the left side of the ArgoUML-
# menubar. After the menu are following the menu's or/and the menuitems of the
# menu. Then follows the next menu...
# 
# Menuitems, you find in action.properties with the keys: action....
# Menuitems of the menu "Select", you find in gef.
# Menuitems of the menu "Zoom", you find in gef.
# Menuitems of Adjust Grid, Adjust Guide and Adjust Pagebreaks, you find in gef.
# Menuitems of the menu Align, you find in gef.
# Menuitems of the menu Distribute you find in gef.
# Menuitems of the menu Reorder you find in gef.
# 
# 
# Note: for the moment I (Ion) decided to remove the mnemonic and to add them
# later as I'm not familiar with the standard mnemonics used for ro_RO so I'll
# try to "discover" the appropriate ones while using ArgoUML (after the entire
# project is localized).
